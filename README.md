# DiscordAI
DiscordAI is a work in progress python application, whose goal is to chill in a vc and talk with the vc members (small talk).

## Roadmap
- [x] Create a Bot
- [x] Let the bot join a vc and listen to the audio bytes while processing it, without the need of using a sink which needs a callback
- [ ] Choosing/Creating a word-by-word or whisper-like ai model to process the stt
- [x] Choosing/Creating a language model for generating responses
- [ ] trained the model
- [ ] milestone: bot is able to understand what was spoken and can generate an acceptable response which is being output in the chat of vc
- [ ] Combining the ai models
- [ ] Learn about tts models and creating one
- [ ] using the tts model to let the bot responde in vc
- [ ] refactoring/optimization

### Disclaimer
It is just a private project for learning to work with AI-Models, Websockets/discord.py and Audio handling. Main focus is on the ai part.
